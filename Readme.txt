Steps to run the python ETL code

1. Create database ecommerce at pgAdmin

1. Open file and terminal using visual studio or other IDE

2. pip install sqlalchemy

3. python3 -m venv venv

4. source venv/bin/activate

5. python3 ETL.py. # run the code

Notes:  The Orders_merge.csv file contains 96478 observations, which takes 30 minutes to run on my computer. I would recommend type python3 ETL.py on the terminal, then go for lunch or dinner, then come back.
